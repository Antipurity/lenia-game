Adventures in a highly dynamic world.

Uses [Le](https://developmentalsystems.org/sensorimotor-lenia/)[nia](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) as the main physics for the game.

Includes a couple dozen levels.
- Puzzle: quite a few emergent mechanics to figure out. Figuring them out and putting them together requires a cunning mind.
- Bullet hell: there are sometimes so many particles on-screen that it becomes a fluid simulation. Dextrous control of one actor surrounded by many factors is often required.
- There is also a mediocre story. Though there is only so much you can write about a broken convolution with a bell-curve nonlinearity and particles.
